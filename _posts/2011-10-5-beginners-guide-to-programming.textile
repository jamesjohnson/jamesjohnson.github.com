title: "Rails and Web Development - Take the First Step"
---

Getting started with web development isn't easy. Looking back to when I started, the first few weeks were the toughest to stick with it. For someone who is new to text editors and the terminal - the installation process can be really overwhelming. I recently went through the process of helping some of my friends get set up with Ruby on Rails and after doing it a few times, I realized it would be helpful to write a post that others looking to get started could refer to.

The following is not going to fully explain the steps (which at some point will be important to understand). Instead, I tried to give explicit instructions for creating a working rails environment that hopefully will be easy for anyone with a Mac to follow. If you are interested in getting started with web dev but not sure where to begin, this is for you!

1) This tutorial won't work on a PC and the process is a little different for Ubuntu (which I first started on). You can buy used macbooks on eBay pretty cheap, or dualboot your PC with Ubuntu. I had someone who knew what they were doing help me with the latter when I started - but I do think a Mac is the easiest option.

2) Install Xcode in the app store. If you have the Lion operating system installed, it's free. You can also get Lion in the app store.

3) Once Xcode is installed - next step is installing homebrew. The homebrew github is <a href='https://github.com/mxcl/homebrew/wiki/installation'>here.</a> All you need to do is open your terminal from Spotlight.
<img src='/images/posts/learning_rails/spotlight.png' />
and copy and paste in the following command:

<code>/usr/bin/ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.github.com/gist/323731)"</code>

It should look something like this:
<img src='/images/posts/learning_rails/terminal.png' />
From here you should see a bunch of output. If there are any points where you are asked a question, just hit enter.

4) After Xcode is installed - its time to install git. This is really easy to do with the homebrew install. In the same way that you copy and pasted the homebrew install, you copy and paste the following line of code which will install git.

<code>brew install git</code>

Again there will be a bunch of output, but there shouldn't be any issues with the install.

5) Next step is installing RVM - this is a ruby tool that makes managing different versions of ruby much easier. When I started this was really confusing for me, so don't worry about it too much right now. If you would like to read up on RVM (which you should!) the link is  <a href='http://beginrescueend.com/'>here.</a> To install RVM copy and paste the following (same as before) into the terminal.
<code>bash < <(curl -s https://raw.github.com/wayneeseguin/rvm/master/binscripts/rvm-installer)</code>

6) This is the most complicated part of the install for a new user, you need to add RVM to your path so that you can access it everytime you use the terminal. This is done by creating or adding to an existing .bashrc file. In your terminal copy and paste the following:

<code>vim ~/.bashrc</code>

You are using a text editor that allows you to edit files. Vim has a series of commands that are great for developers but hard for a first timer to pick up. <a href='http://yannesposito.com/Scratch/en/blog/Learn-Vim-Progressively/>Here</a> is a great tutorial - definitely worth checking out.

If there is code existing in this file, use the down arrow go to the bottom of the file and press the letter <span class='light'>o</span>. If you make a mistake at any point. Hit the <span class='light'>esc</span> key and press <span class='light'>u</span> (<span class='light'>u</span> will undo your changes). Once at the bottom of the file, after pressing <span class='light'>o</span>, paste on a new line the following code:

<code>[[ -s $HOME/.rvm/scripts/rvm ]] && . $HOME/.rvm/scripts/rvm</code>

Once the code is there press the <span class='light'>esc</span> key, then type in the following <span class='light'>:wq</span>. the <span class='light'>:wq</span> should show up in the bottom nav of the program, you should not be typing this into the file itself. <span class='light'>:w</span> is the command to save a file in vim and <span class='light'>:q</span> is the command to quit, together they will save and quit. When you type <span class='light'>:wq</span> it will save the ~/.bashrc file and exit. The image below is how it should look (ignore the colors) if you do it right.

7) After adding RVM to the path, you will need to exit out of the terminal and reopen it. Next step is to install Ruby and then Rails! To do so, copy and paste in the following commands to the terminal:

This will install Ruby 

<code>rvm install ruby-1.9.2-p290</code>

Once it is done installing you need to tell RVM that you would like to use Ruby 1.9.2

<code>rvm use 1.9.2</code>

You should get a green confirm message that this worked, next time to install Rails. First confirm gems are updated and then install Rails.

<code>gem update --system</code>

<code>gem install rails</code>

8) You won't need this right away, but to use 3rd party libraries (called gems in Rails) you should install bundler now. Really helpful way to manage 3rd party software your applications will rely on.

<code>gem install bundler</code>

9) Now create your first Rails app! 
<code>rails new blog</code>

and then type in the following to "change directory" into your new application. Imagine that CD is the same as using a mouse to click on a directory to view its files. cd is the same concept. 

<code>cd blog</code>

and generate some scaffolding code, migrate the database, and start the server (this will create your first app!):
<code>rails g scaffold post title:string body:text published:boolean</code>
<code>rake db:migrate</code>
<code>rails s</code>

10) Now check out the following url to see your first rails app: <a href='http://0.0.0.0:3000/posts'>http://0.0.0.0:3000/posts</a>.

Next steps are checking out the following guides and resources:

<a href='http://guides.rubyonrails.org/'>Rails Guide</a>: Read through as much as you possibly can
<a href='http://railscasts.com/'>Railscasts</a>: Watch the lessons and try to copy, these helped me the most as I learned
<a href='http://stackoverflow.com/'>Stackoverflow</a>: Ask and search for questions you have here

Your first question is probably how do I edit stuff? You can use vim to open up any of the files in application you just made. For example

<code>vim app/views/posts/index.html.erb</code> 

This will open the index file and you can play around with changing words etc.

Have fun and good luck!
